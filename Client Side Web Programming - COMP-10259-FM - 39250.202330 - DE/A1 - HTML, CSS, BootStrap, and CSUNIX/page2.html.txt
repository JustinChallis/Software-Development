                <h2>What I've Learned during my Mohawk Career</h2><br>
                <p>
                    When I first began at Mohawk College, I really didn't know much about coding or web design at all. I didn't really understand even the basics of creating variables<br>
                    
                    I learned very quickly through taking many different classes such as Python, Java, HTML/CSS and even math courses. This helped me to develop a better understanding of what would be 
                    required of me in the years to come. I learned that I would be able to create beautiful websites, programs that do mathematical equations and also even be able to create objects like 
                    trees our in the environment. Furthermore I could design programs that would explain and give information about how the tree grows or even how it bears fruit. These are all things that
                    exist in the real world and to think that I would be able to create them all, had me really excited.<br>

                    So far, I've created a few programs and even some games with my knowledge that I've gained from Mohawk College and I'm very excited about that. I'm even currently developing a game with 
                    a few friends in my own personal time while I'm not busy doing school work or working at my part time job. I really love that I have learned so much from this course and I can't be more 
                    pleased with where it will take me. This whole experience has been the best of my life so in part, I thank COVID for providing me with an opportunity.
