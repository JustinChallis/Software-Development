                <p class ="par"></p>Hello! My name is Justin Challis. When COVID first happened
            I was laid off from selling cars because the car market was not the same post-COVID as it was 
            before COVID. People were able to come into the dealership and ask questions about cars and I was 
            able to explain to them, based on our conversation, what car was a good fit. When COVID happened,
            people started to do more shopping online and given the fact that they could no longer enter into a dealership
            without the hastle of wearing a mask and disinfecting, people were turned away from in-person shopping. It was 
            during this time that I realized the car industry no longer had a place for me. I decided to attend Mohawk College for 
            software support as this is a means to exlpore a new avenue and to really broaden my horizons long term. I had also met 
            my wife during that time and knew that I would need something more concrete as opposed to commision based selling.</p>
